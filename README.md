# My100DaysSQLChallenge
Follow my 100-day journey of mastering SQL and exploring the powerful world of data manipulation and analysis. Each day, I'll be working on SQL problems, learning window functions, honing my query skills, and sharing my progress here. Join me as I dive into SQL magic, and together, let's conquer data challenges and unlock valuable insights! 

## DAY 0 (INTRODUCTION)
According to Malcolm Gladwell, he said, "It takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in anything.". According to the general opinion, SQL is one of the most important tools a data specialist Is meant to master (if not the most important). So, I am dedicating the next 100 days to solving different SQL problems. The problem will cover different SQL topics. The SQL tool I will majorly use throughout the challenge is MySQL and occasionally, I will pitch in different methods peculiar to other SQL tools like MSSQL and PostgreSQL.
