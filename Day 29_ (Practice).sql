(as in "Like a Facebook Page"). Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero 
likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.*/

/*Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by
 month. The output should display the month as a numerical value, product ID, and average star rating 
 rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output first by month and then by product ID.*/

/*Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email
and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives 
a text message confirmation to activate their account. Write a query to display the user IDs of those 
who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.*/
